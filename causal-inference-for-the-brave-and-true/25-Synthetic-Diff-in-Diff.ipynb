    "# 25 - Synthetic Difference-in-Differences\n",
    " \n",
    "In previous chapters, we looked into both Difference-in-Differences and Synthetic Control methods for identifying the treatment effect with panel data (data where we have multiple units observed across multiple time periods). It turns out we can merge both approaches into a single estimator. This new Synthetic Difference-in-Differences estimation procedure manages to exploit advantages of both methods while also increasing the precision (decreasing the error bars) of the treatment effect estimate.\n",
    " \n",
    "We will discuss Synthetic Difference-in-Differences mostly in the case of **block treatment assignment**. This means we observe multiple units across time and, at the **same** time, some units are treated while other units remain untreated. We can visualize this by a matrix of treatment assignments $D$, where the **columns of the matrix are units** and **rows of the matrix are time periods**.\n",

    "To make things more concrete, let's follow along with the example of estimating the impact of Proposition 99 in California's Cigarette consumption. In this case, we only have one treated unit, California, that gets treated (passed Proposition 99) at some point in time (November 1988, to be precise). If we say California is the last column of the matrix, we get something like this:\n",

    "Notice that here we are only talking about the case where all treated units get the treatment **at the same point in time**. In the end, we will discuss how to handle **staggered addoption treatment assignment**, where the treatment is gradually rolled out to units, causing them to get it at different points in time. The only thing we'll require in that design is that, once a unit is treated, it doesn't roll back to being untreated.\n",
    " \n",
    "Back to the simple case, where we have all units treated at the same time, we can simplify the treatment assignment matrix to four blocks, each represented by another matrix. In general, as we move down the matrix, we are moving forward in time. We will also group the treated units to the right of the matrix. As a result, the first block in our matrix (top left) correspond to the control units prior to the treatment period; the second one (top right) corresponds to the treated units prior to the treatment period; the third block (bottom left) contains the control units after the treatment period and the fourth block (bottom right) is the treated unit after the treatment period. The treatment indicator is zero everywhere except for the block with the treated units after the treatment period. \n",

    " \n",
    "We will use the above matrix representation whenever we talk about estimating the synthetic control weights, but there is also another data representation which is useful, especially if we are talking about DiD. In this representation, we have a table with 5 columns: one representing the units, one representing the time periods, the outcome column and two boolean columns flagging the treated units and the treatment period. The number of rows in this table is the number of units $N$ times the number of periods $T$. Here you can see what it looks like for the Proposition 99 data:"

    "This estimate should be taken with a grain of salt, though. We know that Diff-in-Diff requires the trend in the control group to be equal to that of the treated group in the absence of the treatment. Formally, $E[Y(0)_{post, co} - Y(0)_{pre, co}] = E[Y(0)_{post, tr} - Y(0)_{pre, tr}]$. This is an untestable assumption, but looking at the pre-treatment trend of California (the treated unit) and the other states, we can get a feeling for how plausible it is. Specifically, we can see that the trend in `cigsale` for California is not parallel to the other states, at least in the pre-treatment periods. Cigarette sales in California are decreasing faster than the average of the control states, even prior to the treatment. If this trend extends beyond the pre-treatment period, the DiD estimator will be downward biased, meaning that the true effect is actually less extreme than the one we've estimated above."

As we've already discussed, the Diff-in-Diff estimator is probably biased in this case, since we have pretty good reasons to question the parallel trends assumption. What is perhaps less obvious is why the SDID estimate is smaller than the traditional SC estimate. If we go back and look at the SC plot, we can see that cigarette sales in California started to fall below its synthetic control prior to Proposition 99. This is probably due to the fact that traditional Synthetic Control has to match treated and control units in the entire pre-treatment period, causing it to miss one year or the other. This is less of an issue in SDID, since the time weights allow us to focus just on the periods that are more similar to the post-intervention period. In this case, those were precisely the three years anteceding Proposition 99. \n",

The difference between the two solid purple lines is the estimated $ATT$. We start those lines in 1987 to show how the time weights zero out all periods but 1986, 87 and 88.

    "As you can see, we have two groups of states. One with only California, which was treated starting in 1989, and another with the three new states we've created, which were all treated starting in 1993. Now, we need to run SDID for each of those groups. We can easily do that, but keeping just the control units plus one of those groups. There is a catch, though. The `after_treatment` column will have a different meaning, depending on which group we are looking at. If we are looking at the group containing only California, `after_treatment` should be `year >= 1989`; if we are looking at the group with the new states, it should be `year >= 1993`. Fortunately, this is pretty easy to account for. All we need is to recreate the `after_treatment` in each iteration. "

Remember how we said, in the very beginning, that SDID has better precision (lower error bars) when compared to Synthetic Controls? The reason is that the time and unit fixed effects in SDID capture a ton of the variation in the outcome, which in turn, reduces the variance of the estimator.\n",

It turns out there are many solutions to this problem, but only one that fits the case for a single treated unit, which is the case we have here since only California was treated. The idea is to run a series of placebo tests, where we pretend a unit from the control pool is treated, when it actually isn't. Then, we use SDID to estimate the $ATT$ of this placebo test and store its result. We re-run this step multiple times, sampling a control unit each time. In the end, we will have an array of placebo $ATT$s. The variance of this array is the placebo variance of the SDID effect estimate, which we can use to construct a confidence interval.\n",

    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "Synthetic-Diff-in-Diff (SDID) draws inspiration from both Diff-in-Diff and Synthetic Control, which brings advantages from both models.  Like SC, SDID still works with multiple periods when pre-treatment trends are not parallel. However, unlike SC, SDID estimates unit weights to build a control unit which is only parallel to the treated group (it doesn't have to match its level). From DID, SDID leverages time and unit fixed effects, which helps to explain a lot of the variance in the outcome, which in turn reduces the variance of the SDID estimator. Synthetic-Diff-in-Diff also introduces some new ideas of its own. First, there is an additional $L2$ penalty in the optimization of the unit weights which makes them more spread out across control units. Second, SDID allows for an intercept (and hence, extrapolation) when building such weights. Third, SDID introduces the use of time weights, which are not present in either DID nor SC. For this reason, I wouldn't say SDID is just merging SC and SDID. It is rather building something new, inspired by these two approaches. I also wouldn't say that SDID is better or worse than traditional Synthetic Control. Each of them have different properties that might be appropriate or not, depending on the situation. For example, you might find yourself in a situation where allowing the extrapolations from SDID is dangerous. In which case, SC might be a good alternative.  \n",
